# Global Data Science Challenge 2024 Submission: Multi-Agent System for PIRLS 2021 Database Querying

This repository contains my submission for the Global Data Science Challenge 2024 hosted by Capgemini, UNESCO, and AWS. The challenge focuses on building innovative, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems to answer user questions by querying the PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) 2021 database. The project leverages CrewAI for building and coordinating multiple intelligent agents that collaboratively search, interpret, and deliver relevant answers from PIRLS data.

# Challenge Overview
The Global Data Science Challenge 2024 began on September 30, 2024, and called for solutions that could enhance educational data accessibility through advanced AI tools. The primary objective is to design a multi-agent system with LLMs to receive questions from users and use agents to extract insights from PIRLS 2021, facilitating global understanding of educational data.
